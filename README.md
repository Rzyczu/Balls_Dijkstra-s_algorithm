# Balls - Dijkstra's algorithm
A simple game of moving balls to get at least 3 balls of the same color. With each move, new balls are added to the board.
<br/>
The game uses the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path before moving the ball (for the ball to be moved there must be a path between the old position and the new position of the ball)
